                                <p>Colors are what the human eye sees whenever 
                                    light reflects off a surface.</p>
                                <p>Throughout human history, most colors were given a 
                                    variety of interpretations, based on their cognitive 
                                    effect (cooler hues tend to give an idea of calmness, 
                                    while warmer hues give the idea of energy), historical 
                                    contexts (purple as a color was related to royalty,
                                    due to its costly production in the past which could 
                                    only be afforded by the rich), or presentations in 
                                    nature (A poison dart tree frog has a variety of colors,
                                     signaling its toxicity).</p>
                                <p>Color theory puts these ideas into practice, establishing
                                    patterns which seek to move the human heart and mind, 
                                    symbolism provided to those who seek analysis.

                                <p>This lesson tackles the multitude of forms which 
                                    color can take, specifically how well certain hues 
                                    match with each other.</p>

                                from another. The hue is mostly decided by 
                                what colors the material cannot absorb from 
                                visible light.

                                reflected as red.

                                Color has a dominating role in many forms of 
                                media, setting the tone or theme of every project. 
                                It can replicate reality or give a reinterpretation 
                                of it. It allows distinction between characters, 
                                props, and backgrounds. It even makes the human 
                                brain react emotionally depending on the color used.

                        A sunset by itself inspires a sense of wonder and 
                        melancholy by itself, but in the context of various
                        themes and patterns, it may turn into a different 
                        feeling entirely, like welcoming the end of the day,
                        where you can just grab a cigarette with a friend
                        beside you and watch as the stars shine on one by
                        one.

                        You could even take meaning from something so
                         abstract and surreal that it takes a voracious
                         appetite for many kinds of media to tackle. Perhaps
                         the all-encompassing red which covers the room below
                         themes it in a violent light, which we expect of the
                         color red, but the context of the scene seems to subvert
                         it, promoting serenity and jovialness.

                                    concepts which had existed before them. 
                                    The emotion of color is entirely reliant on our own
                                    perceptions, memories, experiences and the like. To 
                                    see the emotion within such forms of media is to use
                                    your life as lenses to look through.
